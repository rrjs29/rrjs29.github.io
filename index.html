      <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher working with <span>Prof. <a href="https://www.jcburtonlab.com/" target="_blank">Justin C. Burton</a></span> in the Deparment of Physics at Emory University. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics working with <span>Prof. <a href = "https://arratia.seas.upenn.edu/" target = "blank">Paulo E. Arratia</a></span> at the University of Pennsylvania in 2023. Prior to coming to the US, I received my bachelor in Power and Energy Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2017.</p>

<p>My research focuses on applying fluid mechanics to understand the flow in natural environments and the associated physical, chemical, and biological processes, in order to predict, mitigate, and manage environmental issues. This interdisciplinary field is known as environmental fluid mechanics. My current research involves two aspects of the field: aquatic ecology (locomotion and transport of planktonic and swimming microbes) and the rheology of natural materials (such
as mud, soil and clay). In my future work, I plan to expand my research by 1) understanding the roles of ocean currents in the growth and spatial distribution of marine plankton, and 2) developing models of ice rheology for modeling ice sheets and ice shelves. </p>
